# Potato Chips

A set of fun and useful utilities for [Logic World](https://logicworld.net)

## Disclaimer

Most of these mods should work on fine, even on servers. However, things break and when they do feel free to [open a ticket](/issues) and I'll try to fix it.

## Installation

All you need to do is download or clone the repo and add it under the `GameData` folder of your Logic World game files.

# Modules

## D Flip Flop

This is a simple chip that acts just like a D Latch except that it triggers on the edge of a clock signal.
